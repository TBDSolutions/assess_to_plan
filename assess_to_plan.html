Before we get started, let’s get settled.

We’re talking about how to supplement a specific portion of the PCP process, but this doesn’t replace the basics!

### Quick Self-Test:
- Are you looking into the person’s eyes?
- Is your body facing the person or a screen?

## Why bother?
- Why use assessment data? 
- Why not just talk? 
- What’s the point?
]

???
### Notes
- *Why use assessment data?*: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use a common language about areas of need can serve as a platform.  Information from the assessment can provide consistent language for discussing goals and needs as part of person-centered planning.
- *Why not just talk?*: The purpose of using information *is* to kickstart a meaningful and comprehensive conversation.
- *What’s the point?*: Use information to spark reflection. Observations from data can be an opportunity for self-discovery. It is not the final word, but a starting point for reflection. *Example*: Myers-Briggs, StrengthsFinder, etc.

# Let's try it out

???
### Notes:
- *Step 1*:  Split room in half.  Then, split each half into 2 sections.  These sections correspond to ‘Snap Judgment’ and ‘Data Only’
- *Step 2*:  Select one person from each section to go through a pre-plan process
- *Step 3*:  Hand out sheets
- *Step 4*:  For each group, ask “What was missing?”, “How close was this to a rushed PCP pre-plan?”

## Act natural

### Notes:
- Conversational data...
- Can you think of a way to have a natural conversation using the data shown here?
- How might you use assessment data similarly?

# Framing a Conversation

.pull-left[
- ### Take a Broad View
- ### Say No to COPY|PASTE
- ### Provide Clear Choices
]

.pull-right[
Research indicates that:
- We are influenced by our starting point (Sunstein, 2008)
- Simplifying options increases participation ([Iyengar, 2010](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4519/simplicitySeeking.pdf))
- Providing categories to choose from increases satisfaction with choice ([Mogilner, 2008](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/706b/84d3567ba03939c3748c94dae36a74a5a64f.pdf)).
]

???
### Notes:

*Take the broad view*:
- Because what you start with influences what you get.
- If an assessment is broad enough to cover multiple areas of a person’s life, it can set the stage for a person-centered planning process which encompasses all areas of a person’s life.

*Say No to COPY|PASTE*:
- Defaults and the temptation to copy/paste (Sunstein, 2008).  - Would you rather have the default scope for the PCP discussion be all life areas, or the ones addressed last year?

*Provide Clear Choices*:
- Because trying to juggle too many balls needs us to drop them all
- Simplify without over-simplifying: an art
- Informed by, not determined by!  Use in pre-planning allows the person to decide what gets addressed during their PCP Meeting.

## Where Do Your Goals Fit?

*I want to improve my...*   | *So I need some support with...*
--------------------------- | -------------------------------- 
**Emotional Wellbeing**         | Behavioral Supports, Health and **Safety**
**Relationships** | Social Activities, Community Living
**Material Wellbeing**         | Employment
**Personal Development**       | Health and Safety, Lifelong Learning
**Physical Wellbeing**         | Health and Safety, Home Living, Lifelong Learning, Medical Supports
**Rights**                      | Protection and Advocacy
**Self Determination**          | Lifelong Learning, Protection and Advocacy, Social Activities
**Social Inclusion**           | Community Living, Lifelong Learning, Protection and Advocacy

*Based on van Loon, J., et al. Assessing Individual Support Needs to Enhance Personal Outcomes.*

### Notes:

Ask audience for examples of things they would like to improve in their lives.

## Please do *not*...
- Just copy/paste from the assessment
- Treat a [person-as-a-data-point](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/opinion/27verghese.html)
- Use 'because the assessment said' as the reason for a goal
]

???

### Notes:

*Person-as-a-data-point*: If it was as easy to transform a person’s life as it is to change a data point, then we’d all have much easier jobs!
*Because the assessment said*: ~~“Per the SIS John needs the most support in Self Care therefore he will have 23 hours of CLS a week”~~

## Official Guidance

.pull-left[
### Related to parity
“…this approach will not establish or serve as the authorization for the supports and services of an individual and will be used to inform the person-centered planning process which is driven by the individual.”

*Wieferich, J. (2018, October 1). Parity (Letter to PIHP and CMHSP Executive Directors).*
]

.pull-right[
### Also, do NOT use...
- "As an arbitrary methodology for determining the amount, scope, and duration… outside of a person-centered planning process."
- "As a means for achieving budget reductions."
- "As a process which supplants use of medical necessity criteria..."

*Renwick, T. (2015, October 22). Inappropriate Use of Assessments and Screening Tools (Letter to PIHP Executive Directors).*
